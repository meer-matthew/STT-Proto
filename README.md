This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).

# Dynamic Backend Configuration

This app automatically detects your environment and connects to the appropriate backend server:

- **iOS Simulator**: Uses `localhost:5001`
- **Android Emulator**: Uses `10.0.2.2:5001` (special Android emulator address)
- **Physical Devices**: Uses your computer's local network IP address

## How It Works

The app uses `react-native-device-info` to automatically detect whether it's running on a simulator/emulator or a physical device, and connects to the backend accordingly.

## Setup for Physical Devices

When you run `npm start`, `npm run ios`, or `npm run android`, the detect-ip script automatically runs and:

1. Detects your computer's local network IP address
2. Updates `src/config/ip-config.json` with the detected IP
3. The app reads this configuration at runtime

## Manual IP Configuration

If you need to manually update the backend IP (e.g., if you change networks):

```sh
npm run detect-ip
```

This will detect your current IP and update the configuration file.

## Troubleshooting Backend Connection

If the app can't connect to the backend:

1. Make sure the backend server is running on port 5001
2. For physical devices, ensure your device and computer are on the same network
3. Run `npm run detect-ip` to update the IP configuration
4. Check the Metro console for the detected API configuration
